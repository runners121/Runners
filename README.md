Madison Track Readme
==========================
  
Madison Track and field has had some of the most successful seasons in the Jackson Madison County area.  The track team, being the one of the most successful teams at Madison, has not recieved the support it has needed.  The Track team is the team Madison deserves, not the one it needs. So I spoke with my client, also my coach and he thought it would be a great idea to create a website.

My client, Coach Maxwell, wanted to assure we had the right colors, font, and design to represent the Madison Track team.  He wanted me to put the names of the runners on the site also.


The Whole Website:

The Website is supposed to bring information to the public about our team and the current season. It is meant to help bring support to our team.

We did our best to help create a website with the information we needed to bring support.  We made sure the font was the right size and color, and the design was to our standards.

We knew that with the rising generation there are more and more people looking at websites on their phones.  We wanted make an outstanding website on a phone as well as on a desktop.


Favicon:

We had the hardest time putting a favicon into the website.  It took us a while to finally put it in there.  We finally got it with the design of the letter M. We wanted to make sure the favicon represented our team correctly.  So it was created with our official school colors, which are Maroon, Navy, and White.

Home page:

The homepage consists of an overview of our team and values. The location of our school is on a map we embeded from google maps. So if anyone who is interested in knowing where Madison is located, they would know where we are.


Coaches Page: 

The clients, who are also the co-coaches of the team, are posted on a page specifically dedicated to them. This page contains mini biographies about who they are and their experience with Madison or past athletic journeys.


Schedule Page:

Every existing track meet for the season has been uploaded to the website for reference.


Testimonials Page:

This testimonials page shows quotes of past and present students who have participated in track at Madison. The sayings describe what it feels like to be on a team such as Madison's, along with the hard work endured while growing on the team.


Contact Page: 

The contact page is for anyone interested in joining the track team. If any information is needed, this is a direct way of contacting the coaches on a student's behalf.
